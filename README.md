# Mike Oats Custom Milk Floats

> Like a true nature's child, I was born, born to be wild - Mike Oat

This was a project for Codecademy using flexbox and relative units. This business does not exist and this was just a bit of fun but having said that, In my mind Mike Oat rides a Harley themed milk float everywhere and never takes his sunglasses off. He says things like "Right on" and "All power to ya"

##Nifty stuff

I really like how this site turned out. The colours work well together and it gave me the chance to design the custom milk float company of my dreams. Who could ask for more?

## To be improved

I would really like to turn this into a full website with interactive webpages and go really in depth on the whole milk float idea. I'll get around to it one day I'm sure.
